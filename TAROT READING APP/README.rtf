\
This project simulates a tarot card reading by randomly drawing six tarot cards from a pre-defined tarot deck, determining whether each card is drawn upright or reversed, and then using OpenAI's GPT-3 (or a successor model) to generate a personalized tarot reading based on those cards.\
\
Features\
\
- Simulates a tarot reading by drawing six cards from a deck.\
- Determines whether each card is drawn in an upright or reversed position.\
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate a unique interpretation based on the drawn cards.\
\
How to Run the App\
\
1. Install the OpenAI Python library:\
   You need to have the OpenAI library installed to communicate with the GPT-3 API. You can install it using pip:\
\
   pip install openai\
\
2. Add Your OpenAI API Key:\
   Before running the application, ensure you have an OpenAI API key. You can get your key by signing up at https://beta.openai.com/signup/.\
\
   Once you have your API key, you can set it as an environment variable in your terminal:\
\
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'\
\
3. Run the Application:\
   After setting up the environment and installing the necessary dependencies, run the Python script:\
\
   python tarotaiapp.py\
\
   The app will randomly draw six tarot cards and display whether they are upright or reversed. Then, it will use GPT-3 to provide a tarot reading based on the drawn cards.\
\
File Structure\
\
- tarotaiapp.py: The main application that handles the tarot reading and GPT-3 integration.\
- tarot_deck: A pre-defined dictionary containing tarot card names along with their upright and reversed meanings.\
\
Customization\
\
You can customize the tarot deck by editing the tarot_deck dictionary inside the script to include additional cards or modify existing ones. The card meanings can be adjusted to fit the style or tradition of tarot reading you prefer.\
